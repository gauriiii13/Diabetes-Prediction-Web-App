# Diabetes-Prediction-Web-App

## INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction System GitHub repository! This repository contains the code for a web application that predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on certain input features. The prediction is made using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, which is trained on a labeled dataset with relevant features.

The web application is built using Streamlit, and it is hosted on Streamlit Cloud. This allows you to interact with the model and get predictions in real-time through a user-friendly interface.

## DEMO
You can check out the live demo of the Diabetes Prediction System on Streamlit Cloud: Diabetes Prediction System

## MODEL DETAILS
The prediction model in this project is based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. It is trained on a labeled dataset containing various features related to diabetes diagnosis. The model is saved in a file named 'diabetes_model.sav', which is included in this repository.

The features used for prediction include (Pregnancies,Glucose,BloodPressure,SkinThickness,Insulin,BMI,DiabetesPedigreeFunction,Age). The dataset used for training the model is not included in this repository due to its large size. Here is the link to the dataset from kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database. You can read the details of the dataset here.

The link for Google Colaboratory where I analyzed the dataset and created and saved the model is provided here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19Nag9Qo1E-Ayw0utflMBNkEr_Kv0-Zl4?usp=sharing

## CONTRIBUTING
We welcome contributions to improve the Diabetes Prediction System. If you find any bugs, want to add new features, or enhance the documentation, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Your contributions are highly appreciated!
